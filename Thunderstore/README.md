# SCP966-SleepKiller
This mod adds SCP 966 as a monster in Lethal Company. To see it, the player will have to buy the night vision goggles from [LateGameUpgrade](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/Lategame_Upgrades/). The mod will work without LateGameUpgrade.
[NEW] YOU CAN NOW SEE THE MONSTER BRIEFLY WHENEVER YOU SCAN

<details>
  <summary>Here are its phases and how it works in game if you wanna spoil yourself (spoilers aside tho, the night vision goggles from Lategamecompany might help with SCP 966)</summary>
LateGameUpgrade

### Roaming Phase
It will go around until it detects a player. If the player's stamina is above 10, it will go into the Tiering Phase. If the player's stamina is under 10, it will go into the Chasing Phase.

### Tiering Phase
It will follow the player around, adding to their weight 52 lbs. if the players stamina reaches under 20%, SCP966 will go to the chasing phase

### Chasing Phase
When in the Chasing Phase, it will hunt down the player until they are dead or leave the building. Then, it will go back into the Roaming Phase.
